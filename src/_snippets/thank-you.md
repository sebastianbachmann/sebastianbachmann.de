<p class="lead"Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter! ❤️</p>

I have so much to share with you.

I'm Sebastian Bachmann. I help folks launch iOS apps in the App Store with Turbo Native and Ruby on Rails. I'm also the solo-founder of [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com).

All my emails will come from this address: `guude@sebastianbachmann.de`. The next newsletter should arrive on Monday.

Until then, here are 3 of my favorite things I've written:

1. [Hybrid iOS apps with Turbo](https://masilotti.com/turbo-ios/)
1. [Zero to App Store in 7 weeks](https://masilotti.com/zero-to-app-store-in-7-weeks/)
1. [How I took my SaaS from idea to sold in 14 months](https://masilotti.com/idea-to-sold-in-14-months/)

But please, don't be shy! I'd love to hear from you.

**Can you reply and let me know what you want to learn about Turbo Native?** Then I can create more content on what _you_ need to know.

Once again, thank you for subscribing.

Chat soon,<br>Sebastian Bachmann
